# The Game of Othello
This is the game of othello, also known as reversi, written in JAVA. It enables the user to play the game with some other player, or with a computer
player built into the game.
The computer player uses basic strategies but is still quite powerful.
The user can choose to play the game in a frame view with graphics, or simply on the command line if thier unable to play with graphics properly.

There is also a simulation built into the game for research purposes, where two computer players play together. The client can provide theier own implementation of 
a computer player and play with the implementation given.

The only Java class to run is OthelloMain, which has some global constatnts to set what type of view the user wants, and if the game needs to be simulated or not.

I still have to add the how to play section, but a simple google search would be more than sufficent to know how to play Othello/Reversi.

Enjoy the game with your friends, or with the computer player! See by what margin can you beat my player!
