# The Game of Othello
This is the game of othello, also known as reversi, written in JAVA. It enables the user to play the game with some other player, or with a computer
player built into the game.
The computer player uses basic strategies but is still quite powerful.
The user can choose to play the game in a frame view with graphics, or simply on the command line if thier unable to play with graphics properly.

## How to run the game
The only Java class to run is OthelloMain, which has a global constatnt to set what type of view the user wants
The defalut run is in frame view

## Simulation of game
There is also a simulation built into the game for research purposes, where two computer players play together. The client can provide theier own implementation of 
a computer player and play with the implementation given. You do not have to worry about simulation at all if you just want to play the game, unless that is what you want to do.

## Expected of user
I still have to add the how to play section, but a simple google search would be more than sufficent to know how to play Othello/Reversi.

 ### Enjoy the game with your friends, or with the computer player! See by what margin can you beat my player!
